# SRH_circuit_shapes
shapes for analog and digital schematic and related diagrams

These shapes were created in Dia 0.97+ git on Ubuntu, installed with apt-get.  
Please feel free to open an Issue to discuss these.  
Mainly I've created this repo for my own use and to share with colleagues,  
 but I'm happy to share these with the wider community.

## Installation
Copy the shape and png files in shapes/ to your user .dia/shapes directory.
Copy the sheet file(s) in sheets/ to your user .dia/sheets directory.

## Diagram settings
These shapes are intended to be used on a diagram with a 0.25cm grid. 
Connection points are placed in convenient locations.
